# fontdetect

Detect if a font is installed from the browser.

## Installation

Manually add all files in `lib`. No build system is currently setup.

## Usage

```javascript
fontDetect('Verdana')  //=> true
fontDetect('NotAFont') //=> false
```

Or, asynchronously and repeatedly check (useful for web fonts which may not yet be loaded):

```javascript
fontDetect('MyWebFont', function(fontName) {
  console.log(fontName + ' loaded')
})
```

fontDetect will be defined as an AMD module if `define` exists.
